/*
Package faunadb implements the Fauna Query Language (FQL) for Go
applications.

FaunaClient is the main client structure, containing methods to
communicate with a Fauna cluster. This structure is designed to be
reused, so avoid making copies of it.

FQL is composed of expressions that implement the Expr interface.
Expressions are created using the query language functions found in
query.go.

Responses returned by Fauna are wrapped into types that implement the
Value interface. This interface provides methods for transversing and
decoding Fauna values into native Go types.

The driver allows for the user to encode custom data structures.
You can create your own struct and encode it as a valid Fauna object.

	type User struct {
		Name string
		Age  int
	}

	user := User{"John", 24} // Encodes as: {"Name": "John", "Age": 24}

If you wish to control the property names, you can tag them with the
"fauna" tag:

	type User struct {
		Name string `fauna:"displayName"`
		Age  int    `fauna:"age"`
	}

	user := User{"John", 24} // Encodes as: {"displayName": "John", "age": 24}
